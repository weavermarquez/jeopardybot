#+title: Reverse Jeopardy: Neural Question Generation

** Overview
Fine-tuned transformer models (T5, DialoGPT) to generate Jeopardy-style clues from minimal input—inverting the traditional question-answering paradigm. This project explores the challenging task of generating factual, answerable declarative prompts given only a category and target answer.

** Key Technical Contributions
- *Novel Task Formulation*: Defined question generation with sparse input constraints (category + answer only, no context passage)
- *Large-Scale Fine-Tuning*: Trained on 127K cleaned Jeopardy entries using Google Colab TPUs
- *Multi-Model Comparison*: Evaluated T5 (encoder-decoder) vs DialoGPT (decoder-only) architectures
- *Custom Evaluation Framework*: Designed domain-specific metrics for factuality and answerability

** Technical Stack
- *Models*: T5-base (222M params), DialoGPT-small/medium
- *Frameworks*: HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch Lightning, SimpleT5
- *Infrastructure*: Google Colab with GPU/TPU acceleration
- *Data Processing*: Cleaned 217K→127K examples (removed multimedia, wordplay edge cases)

** Results
- T5 achieved 2.48 factuality / 2.44 answerability (5-point scale)
- Best performance on geographic entities (5/5 on Lithuania, Uruguay)
- Identified architectural trade-offs between grammatical fluency and factual accuracy
- Generated coherent prompts across diverse knowledge domains

** Project Context
Course project for CPSC 599.27 (Introduction to NLP) at University of Calgary. Completed comprehensive research including data analysis, model training, evaluation methodology design, and formal academic writeup.
