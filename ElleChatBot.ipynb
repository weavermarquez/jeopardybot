Two weeks ago I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal and I talked her out of buying this truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed.\", 'ELLE: Wish me luck, Bruiser. This is my first class as a serious law student.

Did she do that to you, too?', \"EMMETT: No. But she did make me cry once. Not in class, I waited till I got back to my room, but she'll kick you right in the ball… Or wherever, you know.

Who else do you have?\", 'ELLE: I have Callahan, Royalton, and Levinthal.', \"EMMETT: Yeah… Let's see, speak up in Callahan's class.

Thanks for all your help.', 'ELLE: Hi!', 'WARNER: Uh… So… how was your first class?', \"ELLE: Oh, it was good, except for this horrible preppy girl who made me look bad in front of the professor.

Happens every day. So what's this Vivian got that you don't have? Three tits?\", \"ELLE: She's from Connecticut.

Why do you ask?', 'ELLE: Well, unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one-night stand to determine if a child resulted in those unions, he has no parental claim over this child whatsoever. Why now? Why this sperm?', 'CALLAHAN: I see your point.', 'ELLE: And for that matter, all masturbatory emissions where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg could be termed reckless abandonment.', 'CALLAHAN: Ms. Woods, you did well today.', 'ELLE: Really?', \"CALLAHAN: You're applying for my internship, aren't you?\", \"ELLE: I don't know.\", 'CALLAHAN: You should.

You know her?', \"ELLE: She's a Delta Nu! She wasn't in my pledge class. She graduated four years before me. But I used to take her class at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.\", 'PAULETTE: Oh, my God.', \"ELLE: He's coming over here.\", \"ELLE: He's got a package.\", \"ELLE: That's great, Paulette. Is this the only interaction you two have ever had?\", 'PAULETTE: No. Sometimes I say \"OK\" instead of \"fine.\"', \"ELLE: Why don't you offer him a cold beverage or a neck massage or something?\", \"PAULETTE: Oh, come on, what's the point?\", \"ELLE: Trust me, Paulette. You have all the equipment, you just need to read the manual. Do you know what I'm saying?\", \"ELLE: Okay. I’m gonna show you a little maneuver that my mother taught me in junior high. In my experience, it has a 98% success rate of getting a man's attention, and when used appropriately, it has an 83% rate of return on a dinner invitation.\", 'PAULETTE: Wow!', 'ELLE: It\\'s called the “bend and snap.\" Watch this.', 'ELLE: \"Oh! I think I dropped something on the floor that I need to pick up.\" So you bend… and snap!', 'ELLE: See? Come on. You try it.', 'ELLE: Bend...and snap! Okay, yeah.

You're gonna bend… and snap!\", \"ELLE: Now put your head into it. Bend... and snap! Bend... and snap! Good job! A little attitude, please. Now, everybody smile. That's very important.

Are you all right? You look so... orange.', \"BROOKE: I'm just glad that it's you and not Callahan.\", \"ELLE: He means well. He's very brilliant.\", \"BROOKE: He better be for what I'm paying for him.\", 'ELLE: I have to tell you the real reason I came here.

I went to visit her.', 'CALLAHAN: What the hell do you mean you went to visit her?', 'ELLE: I went to get her alibi.', 'CALLAHAN: Did you get it?', \"ELLE: Mhm. It's really good.\", 'CALLAHAN: Well, great. What is it?', \"ELLE: Oh, I can't tell you.\", 'CALLAHAN: Why the hell not?', \"ELLE: Because I promised her I'd keep it a secret, and I can't break the bonds of sisterhood.\", 'CALLAHAN: Screw sisterhood! This is a murder trial, not some scandal at the sorority house. I want the alibi!', \"ELLE: I can't give it to you, but I can tell you she is innocent.\", 'LAWYER 1: Are you crazy?

And I thought that was very classy of you.', 'ELLE: Really?', 'VIVIAN: Sure.', 'ELLE: Thanks.', \"VIVIAN: Did you ever notice how Callahan never asks Warner to bring him his coffee? I mean, he's asked me at least ten times.\", 'ELLE: Men are helpless. You know that.', \"VIVIAN: I know.

I should have listened.', 'ELLE: Thank you.', 'CALLAHAN: About the alibi...', \"ELLE: I'm sorry-\", \"CALLAHAN: I'm impressed you took the initiative to go get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And, on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys on my payroll.\", 'ELLE: Wow.', \"ELLE: Oh, um, not really. I know it's very competitive.\", 'ELLE: Are you hitting on me?', 'ELLE: So everything you just said...', \"CALLAHAN: I'm a man who knows what he wants.\", \"ELLE: And I'm a law student who just realized her professor is a pathetic asshole.\", 'VIVIAN: You almost had me fooled.', 'ELLE: What?', 'EMMETT: Hey!', \"ELLE: I'm quitting.\", 'EMMETT: Why?', 'ELLE: Law school was a mistake.

The hell with Callahan. Stay.\", \"ELLE: Call me if you're ever in California, okay?\", \"ELLE: What's the point in staying, Paulette? I mean, all people see when they look at me is blond hair and big boobs. No one's ever gonna take me seriously. The people at law school don't. Warner doesn't. I don't think my own parents take me seriously. I just felt, like, for the first time that someone expected me to… to do something more with my life than just become a Victoria's Secret model. But I was just kidding myself. Callahan never saw me as a lawyer, he just saw me as a piece of ass. Just like everybody else. Turns out I am a joke.\", 'ELLE: The hell with law school.

In your office when we were discussing my career.', 'JUDGE: Well, Ms. Woods, proceed.', 'ELLE: Thank you, Your Honor.', 'JUDGE: Ms. Woods, you may begin your questioning.', 'ELLE: Um… First of all I would like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there is a complete lack of mens rea which by definition tells us there can be no crime without a vicious will.', \"JUDGE: I am aware of the meaning of mens rea. What I'm unaware of is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson when you should be questioning your witness.\", 'ELLE: Yes, Your Honor. Um… Miss Windham, when you arrived back at the house, was your father there?', 'CHUTNEY: Not that I saw, but like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.', 'ELLE: And when you came downstairs, what happened?', 'CHUTNEY: I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.', \"ELLE: But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?\", 'EMMETT: Go ahead.', 'ELLE: Miss Windham, did you hear a shot fired?', 'CHUTNEY: No. I was in the shower.', 'ELLE: Okay, so, some time in the 20 minutes that you were in the shower, your father was shot.', 'CHUTNEY: I guess.', \"ELLE: Your father was shot while you were in the shower, but you didn't hear the shot because… because you were in the shower?\", 'EMMETT: Have a little faith, Gerard.', 'ELLE: Um, Miss Windham, what had you done earlier that day?', 'CHUTNEY: I got up, got a latte, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.', 'ELLE: Where you got in the shower?', 'ELLE: Yes, Your Honor. Um, Miss Windham, had you ever gotten a perm before?', 'CHUTNEY: Yes?', 'ELLE: How many would you say?', 'CHUTNEY: Two a year since I was 12. You do the math.', \"ELLE: You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko got a perm once? We all tried to talk her out of it. Curls weren't a good look for her. She didn't have your bone structure. But, thankfully, that same day, she entered the Beta Delta Pi wet t-shirt contest, where she was completely hosed down from head to toe.\", 'JOYCE: Objection! Why is this relevant?', 'ELLE: Oh, I have a point, I promise.', 'JUDGE: Then make it.', \"ELLE: Yes, ma'am. Um, Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?\", 'CHUTNEY: Because they got wet?', \"ELLE: Exactly. Because Isn't it the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you're forbidden to wet your hair for at least 24 hours after getting a perm at the risk of deactivating the ammonium thioglycolate?\", 'CHUTNEY: Y-yes.', \"ELLE: And wouldn't somebody who's had, say, 30 perms in their life be well aware of this rule? And if in fact you weren't washing your hair as I suspect you weren’t, because your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot? And if in fact you had heard the gunshot, Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs, which would mean you would have had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story plausible. Isn't that right?\", \"CHUTNEY: She's my age! Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone who was your age?\", 'ELLE: You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn’t you Chutney?

It is with passion, courage of conviction, and strong sense of self, that we take our next steps into the world, remembering that first impressions are not always correct.', 'ELLE: You must always have faith in people.', 'ELLE: And most importantly, you must always have faith in yourself.
